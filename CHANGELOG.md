### 📊 Performance Improvements

| Metric | v1.x (TypeScript) | v2.0 (Go) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Startup Time | 100-150ms | 5-10ms | **10-20x faster** |
| Binary Size | 400+ MB | 7-15 MB | **96% smaller** |
| Memory Usage | 50-100 MB | 10-20 MB | **3-5x less** |
| Dependencies | Node.js + 2,847 files | 0 files | **∞ better** |

### 🔒 Security Improvements

- Single binary (harder to tamper with)
- No node_modules to scan
- Statically linked (no runtime vulnerabilities)
- Stripped symbols (harder to reverse engineer)
- Minimal OPSEC footprint

### 🗺️ Migration Path

For users of v1.x (TypeScript CLI):

1. Install Go 1.21+
2. Build new CLI: `cd zypheron-go && make build`
3. Install: `sudo make install`
4. All commands work identically

See `zypheron-go/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.
